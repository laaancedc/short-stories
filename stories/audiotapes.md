&emsp;COMMENCE RECORDING

&emsp;- - -

&emsp;We hadn't brought anything aboard with us to celebrate the new year. Anyway, I am doing fairly well, thank you for asking. Nothing has gone wrong a whole six months into our journey to Ceres. Insofar. I was definitely not wishing for troubles to hamper our journey. Cross my heart.

&emsp;The journey would've taken longer than it should if Ceres wasn't, by any chance, on its closest approach to Mars. Not a whole lot should happen, aside from some minor course corrections and the like...

&emsp;And nothing ever did happen, sorry to lead you on like that. We got our gear ready, our tools revved up, among other things. The one that did take up most of the cargo space was the research station. It was designed to fold in, like origami, if you will.

&emsp;It is fairly sturdy however, especially once air begins flowing into it. The lab was outfitted with organics, a water reclamation system, and everything else we needed. Hell, there are even contingencies set in place in the event something really bad happens, so that's cool.

&emsp;We had to send a bulk of the supplies down to the planet first as it would be a hell of a lot easier if we didn't have to manage a couple hundred tons of scientific equipment and supplies as we descended into the planet. We even brought what can only be described as a space-grade Go-Kart along with us. What the fuck are we supposed to do with a Go-Kart?

&emsp;We boarded the *Mercury Mini* (which was the craft to be used to descent to and ascend from the surface), enabled the life-support systems, siphoned a part of the hydrogen propellant from the *Mercury's* reserves, and bid the ship goodbye as we turned off its systems, and allowed it to drift into orbit around Ceres.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Anyway, the operation of the Descent Vehicle was fairly straightforward. The advancement of computers in the past centuries allowed us wiggle room for error, but it was still up to us if we wanted to land and live another day.

&emsp;"Nice and easy... Nice and easy."

&emsp;First words ever uttered on the surface of Ceres. We had to radio Mars soon as we landed as our complete neglect to update the higher ups during the duration of our trip didn't exactly put them at ease. That was to be the first thing on our to-do list.

&emsp;"Mission Control, Mercury Mini has landed. I repeat, Mercury Mini has landed."

&emsp;I didn't exactly know what to say. I supposed that would suffice.

&emsp;There was no response. I mean, of course there wasn't, it would take either 8 minutes or 11 minutes for them to get the message and vice versa, depending on how far out we are from each other.

&emsp;Eight tense minutes later:

&emsp;"..."

&emsp;"Roger. We copy you Mercury I. Not sure if I should tell you this, but the big guys over at NASA aren't exactly pleased with the radio silence. Nonetheless, good job you guys."

&emsp;Well that was comforting...

&emsp;We'd set up the base (which was a relatively quick affair, thanks to the folks over at NASA), then... Shit, we needed power. Solar panels. They folded out on their own, which, I admit was pretty neat. It did scare me shitless the first time around though. 

&emsp;We needed to finish the rest of the base setup before we could put ourselves at ease though, the artificial atmosphere, the station's computer. The comms. I made setup sound simple, but trust me, it wasn't.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Sleeping in a low-gravity environment was freaky. We had to don on these very fluffy, warm "blankets", and fasten ourselves to the stiff bed frame with which we were to sleep on for the entire duration of the mission. The "blankets" offset the rigidness of the bed frame, still does not discount the fact that it was uncomfortable to sleep on the damned thing.

&emsp;Anyway, on to the more important things. We'd begun work on the drill with which we were to draw water-ice from. Apparently uh, let me see here... We're a couple of days away from the drill reaching full operational capability. Not bad.

&emsp;Most of the day has been focused on the setup of the few remaining equipment, chief among these the computer's data bank. The majority of the contents of the data bank is comprised of instruction sets and manuals, but there exists a rumor that the guys responsible for the bank snuck in a composite of all the dictionaries published throughout history.

&emsp;But the data bank wasn't made to store operating manuals and public-domain works. A part of the space was set aside solely for the simulations the computer runs. But the rest of the space? We were meant to fill it up with logs & journals, like this one. Shocked, aren't you?

&emsp;There's more to the story than the details I have recounted to this recorder, but nonetheless, that brings us to "present day", whenever present day is. In Coordinated Universal Time, today would be... Sunday, on the 11th of January, 2133.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Something's always felt wrong since we had switched on the data bank.

&emsp;To start, the computer's oxygen reading had begun shifting around since we connected it to the said bank. Like fuck, we can't really feel at ease if there exists a looming threat of accruing lung injuries, but I digress...

&emsp;Recounting all the things we did today-

&emsp;The fuel cells are now operating at maximum efficiency, and with that, we won't have to solely rely on the solar panels for energy anymore.

&emsp;The data bank has been in operation for half a day now. Minor issues notwithstanding, it's in tip-top shape.

&emsp;We brought the majority of the station, save for the organics and the water reclamation system, to full operational capability. The smell of the station's artificial atmosphere reminds me of 

&emsp;So, I suppose this is where I end the recording. Trust that I won't stop making these for your amusement however. But for now, we shall part. Peace.

&emsp;COMMENCE RECORDING

&emsp;- - -

&emsp;Ah fuck. Fuck.

&emsp;The drill. The drill broke. You know, we could live with a broken drill, but...

&emsp;Technician's dead and mission commander suffered a concussion. I should probably explain whatever happened.

&emsp;The drill had begun operation. There was around 27 miles of crust to bore through, and currently, the drill has worked through 4 miles of it. To note, the drill wasn't even fully operational just yet, but according to ESOC, this apparently shouldn't serve as much of a hindrance, provided we keep it operating at a "comfortable pace".

&emsp;Wonder how ESOC would react to this news. God.

&emsp;Everything was going swimmingly and then... Boom. Big fucking explosion. It was a sight to behold. Beautiful even.

&emsp;Snap back to reality. Operator's in pieces and mission commander is wandering aimlessly through the low gravity environment of Ceres... He got hit.

&emsp;"Why isn't he doing anything?"

&emsp;He was unconcious. Oh shit, I thought.

&emsp;Run, run, run. I grab him just as he was about to fall off to the edge of a crater...

&emsp;Space Go Kart came in handy. The Commander's helmet has just been fractured, and he was rapidly losing oxygen. Strapped him in, manned the vehicle. It was fast. The bumps were exemplified though, the low gravity was doing us zero favors. He was going under quite frequently, speaking in slurred speach in bouts, then silence...

&emsp;Hearing him through the radio was harrowing. He was holding on *to* his dear life. Don't even wanna think about it now.

&emsp;Arrived at the station three minutes later, but the fucking computer wouldn't open the airlock door. Override, overruled. Had to do it manually. The dog (that's what the spinny wheel-handle is formally called) was tight, spinning the damn thing felt like a chore. Airlock opened. Pressed some buttons, air began hissing.

&emsp;"Station pressurized. Oxygen 37-"

&emsp;"21.2%"

&emsp;Interesting.

&emsp;I open the door to the lab, cleared the dining table, lay the poor chap down. Unlocked his helmet, took it off, and... Oh God. The man had a skull fracture.

&emsp;"Everyone, Main Room, NOW!" I screamed.

&emsp;Everyone came rushing in... Two of the crew just vomited, on the spot.

&emsp;"Grab me some sutures and a needle-" I commanded.

&emsp;Someone slid me the first aid kit.

&emsp;To be honest, no amount of basic medical training trained me for suturing an open fucking wound together. Fuck it. The mission commander is halfway through heaven or hell, and I'd rather risk making the situation worse rather than having done nothing.

&emsp;I don't even know if what I did amounted to fuck all or what, but the Commander is still breathing, so I suppose that counts for something. We had to keep him hydrated, albeit with a rudimentary intravenous drip, as we couldn't allow him to just go three days without hydration. I'm still unsure if the drip is actually functioning properly, but I suppose it's better than nothing.

&emsp;... Fuck, I don't wanna talk about it right now.

&emsp;...

&emsp;We hosted a short mass for our late technician, may he rest in peace. Our lack of patience and regard for safety had left us with one less crewmate, and for some, one less friend. We can never bring him back, but I hope that one day we may be able to at least, make amends with those he inadvertently left behind.

&emsp;We did know for a fact that we had no available time to waste, and work was immediately resumed...

&emsp;The damned computer was out to trouble us again. A light slap to the machine, and it was back to working order. No definitive solution could really be found for the faults of the machine. Its annoying fucking alerts were just something else we had to live with.

&emsp;On to more important things.

&emsp;We had messaged the Mission Control in ESOC a couple hours ago, and have yet to receive a response. Mission Control is normally speedy when it comes to correspondence, but... we've waited a tense few hours for a reply, and none came. We'd initially suspected the computer was at fault, but we couldn't really find a just cause for the lack of response.

&emsp;Save for some maintenance work on the Mercury Mini, nothing else was done. The main purpose for our trip to Ceres is now a hundred thousand feet of its surface, in bits and all. Some of the crew contemplated leaving, but without express instructions from the powers that be, none could be done. We were left sitting here, twiddling our thumbs.

&emsp;If you must know, yes, our mission commander lives. Currently unconscious, but we'll take it.

&emsp;...

&emsp;I'm gonna sleep the night off. Going to fix some shit on the *Mini* come tomorrow, and maybe if I feel compelled enough, I might sneak some geology work in.

&emsp;OK, so apparently the *Mini* still utilizes computers which are already two decades old. That might not mean much, but that means the it isn't part of the station's "ecosystem", it doesn't share the station's mainfram... It isn't exactly easy to explain, but all you need to know is that it's safe from the station computer's glitches, it isn't subject to its malfunctions.

&emsp;For the mission commander's own safety, we moved him over to the *Mini*, powered on the life support systems, and hooked some of the available solar panels to the craft.

&emsp;I suppose that alleviated some of the fears that the crew shared. But anyway-

&emsp;Interestingly enough, the fuel supply of the *Mini* had been slowly decreasing ever since our descent onto this planet. Not that it bothered me much as this sort of thing was to be expected, but still. It wasn't like we were leaking plenty, owing to the fact that there was still a lot of propellant left over, so this was merely inconsequential to us. Pray to God this problem won't haunt us in the future.

&emsp;As it is right now, the *Mercury*'s orbit above Ceres is fairly stable so, er, there's that...

&emsp;Still no correspondence from the folks over at the ESOC. Kind of concerning. No scrap that, it is very concerning. I highly doubt that the ESA immediately went defunct after our departure, though it is sort of funny to think about the possibility that the ESA, the *European Space Agency*, folding because of the ponderous cost of the program.

&emsp;Will be performing diagnostics on the station's computer and the data bank first thing in the morning.

&emsp;Ahhh...

&emsp;I- I'm fucking toast.

&emsp;Data bank is 100% toast. Not sure what else can be done and all. We might be able to save some of the data stored in the drives, but outside of that, this amalgamated mass of scrap wouldn't serve any purpose.

&emsp;Next thing we did, we patched all the recoverable drives into the station mainframe, hoping that, at least, we can recover as much data as we possibly can.

&emsp;"Multiple volumes detected. Cumulative data size, 36.2 Terabytes."

&emsp;What the fuck. What sort of machine, or data, or anything for that matter, could possbily need that much space? Nonetheless, copying everything over to our personal machines was going to take some time. We hooked all the devices (that were capable of speedy data transfers) up to the computer, did some data sorting, techy tech stuff, yada yada yada... If we did our job properly, all the data should be neatly sorted across all devices. Save for some possible technical glitches, nothing should go wrong. Right?

&emsp;I decided to look into the drives' contents while everything was being copied.

&emsp;And uhhh...

&emsp;Most of the shit in the drives were algorithms, or something, I don't really know. Keep in mind that we weren't able to recover all the drives, so I suppose there's a big fat chance that the majority of the data stored in the bank were just a bunch of math equations that amount to nothing but a glitchy fucking mess.

&emsp;Surprisingly, there weren't logs of all the correspondences to be found, or at least, none were found in the folder that they should be stored in, which was interesting. I haven't finished skimming through all the directories yet, so if somethiing does arise, trust that I'll be here to tell you all about it.

&emsp;Anyway, outside of that, well... We've begun work on bringing the station to its full operational capability.

&emsp;The Organics Wing can, in three months, now yield enough crop for, get this: twenty people. Cool isn't it? We've managed to fit as much crops into a single room as we can, and thanks to all the GMO work done by all the splendid botanists over at NASA, we've managed to make efficient every single square meter of the Wing.

&emsp;Speaking of these GMO crops (or seeds), we were, er... allow me to first get the list.

&emsp;...

&emsp;We were given like a shit-ton of these crops, and seeds, and all. Potatoes, turnips, carrots... root crops made up most of the organic material sent down here to us. These aforementioned root crops were full of all the nutrients that we need to... not die. After all, efficient foods, they are. Jokes aside, overall, we had-

&emsp;6 kilograms of potatoes, 3 kilograms of turnips, 3 kilograms of carrots, and a quarter kilogram of other "assorted seeds". That's what it said on the package.

&emsp;A part of the potatoes, turnips, and carrots were all root crops, so it's not like we could really just throw them in the microwave and eat them... We'd die.

&emsp;Nonetheless, we might be stuck down here for a long while, so we might as well get acclimated to this stark, white, artificial habitat we currently reside in, so. Gotta get comfortable, because the way shit looks right now, we might be marooned in here for a while.

&emsp;Hey all. Past three days have been relatively calm, so I guess I've got God to thank for that. Or whoever, I don't know.

&emsp;mission commander's still in a state of comatose. We haven't the slightest idea what to do with him, seeing that our crew's Doctor isn't fully versed in the matters of the brain and all. Nonetheless, I've, albeit inadvertently, become this mission's de facto leader, and erm, I don't really know if I'm up to the task. I've got a dastardly habit for gambling more than I can really stomach, and shit, there really isn't a way to know whether or not your luck has run out.

&emsp;I'd never expected my shoddy stitching job to really work to stabilize his critical condition.

&emsp;Nonetheless, I can only hope that my luck can carry us through the duration of this mission. If not well, I reckon I should have my wits about me. Out here, in total isolation, recklessness is a death sentence.

&emsp;I'd figured out why our most recent correspondence hadn't seen a reply: the station's mainframe hadn't even sent the fucking message. Like, the antenna seemed to be working just fine, and the power had been flowing through the station since we first set foot here. We still haven't found a fix to our problem, so we were to do everything solo until a solution presents itself.

&emsp;We've been deliberating on docking back to the ship so that we might be able to utilize the ummm... the ship's mainframe computer in order to hopefully re-open correspondence with Mission Control. Multiple ideas had been thrown around on how we could go by doing this but unfortunately, none would stick.

&emsp;The idea of sending one man to be our designated "spokesman" had been considered, but the problem with this idea is that we have no way of knowing what sort of shit Mission Control would tell us, or what the aforementioned "spokesman" would say *to* Mission Control.

&emsp;Abandoning base altogether isn't exactly an unfavourable idea, but it's a fairly unpopular one amongst us all for obvious reasons. I suppose we'd developed a sort of attachment with this very place. We could escape it, but inside us, our subconscious, even in the deepest crevasses of our mind, it will forever stay.

&emsp;... I suck at poetry.

&emsp;COMMENCE RECORDING

&emsp;- - -

&emsp;Well.

&emsp;We've decided to leave the station for a while, at least until we've re-opened communication with Mission Control. 

&emsp;We managed to get the communications systems up and running once more, and re-sent all the correspondences that failed to leave our station. The plan was to stay in this craft, awaiting further orders from all the people back on ESOC Mission Control...

&emsp;Around 30-something minutes later, we've received a letter from Mission Control, asking us to hang tight while they "figure shit out". I reckon I'd sent one too many pieces of information. There was definitely a lot to unpack, after all, so I wouldn't put that past them. I wonder how the higher ups would respond to this.

&emsp;Our mission commander still hasn't awoken. We're unsure of how we can feed him though, seeing that he's currently capable of doing fuck all... A nasogastric apparatus should do the job, but seeing that none of us have the necessary experience to insert tubes into vital organs, we thought it best to just wait for Mission Control to direct us on what to do next.

&emsp;Well um, that's all for today I suppose.

&emsp;We asked for directions, and directions, we have received.

&emsp;Mission Control made it imperative that we take as much as we can retrieve, crops, equipment, data and all, and return to civilization, and by civilization, they meant the settlement in Arcadia Planitia.

&emsp;It was going to be to our advantage that we don't fill our cargo hold, and seeing that the fuel on both the *Mini* and the *Mercury* was limited, we had to plan our inventory. 2 trips to the surface was the most we can allow in order to conserve as much of the Mini's fuel as possible.

&emsp;We were to take our first trip tomorrow, and our second the day after, in order to allow us time to set up any equipment we take from the base, and to manage and store other miscellaneous items like food, medicals, ballpens... you get the idea.

&emsp;On to the matter of our commander's well being... the ESOC had given us instructions on the creation of an improvised nasogastric tube, its insertion down the nose, and its operation. We had most of the required materials to create this tube, but fuck, we lacked the very thing we needed to be able to verify a successful insertion: pH test strips.

&emsp;Fuck it. We were going to continue with the intubation and pray that we did our job right...

&emsp;The doctor and I had managed to insert an improvised nasogastric tube down to his stomach. Whether this venture was sucessful or not, we have no idea. There was no definitive way to know if we really had reached his stomach, or if the tube had strayed off and went somewhere else.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Anyway, I might be sleeping earlier than usual tonight, seeing that we have a long day ahead of us tomorrow.

&emsp;See you all soon. Peace.

&emsp;Well... we had completed taking the electronics and any other moving parts back up to the ship. That was about half the shit we needed to return back to... wherever, I don't know. The Arcadia settlement, I think it was? Anyway.

&emsp;...

&emsp;So, the Organics Wing was short-lived, but hell, it was fun seeing the plants multiply exponentially as the days passed. 

&emsp;In the end, we were left with an additional ~0.5 kilograms of potatoes, ~0.3 kilograms of turnips, and ~0.2 kilograms of carrots. Not a bad yield, considering that we'd only been here for over three weeks... With that, we're to box all of these up and send it up to the *Mercury* first thing in the morning.

&emsp;This was the last time we'll ever get to sleep and do other things on this station. The atmosphere (metaphorical atmosphere) surrounding the station was somber-ish. We'd invested plenty of time and effort into the mission, we had invested months of our lives into training for this mission...

&emsp;Whatever had happened was out of our hands, but still.

&emsp;It has indeed been a long day. See you all back at the station tomorrow.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Me, my co-pilot, and our unconscious mission commander...

&emsp;That's it. We are all that's left of this damned mission.

&emsp;...

&emsp;As I was preparing the *Mini* for our final ascent off the surface, three of the crew had returned to the station, gathering all the boxes of crops, and to add, theirs and everyone else's personal effects, mementos and all.

&emsp;I'd spent most of the time managing whatever was already stored away in the *Mini*'s hold, and performing basic diagnostics on its mainframe, warranting our crew's safety for the short trip back to the ship.

&emsp;Shit. I'd been bored to tears.

&emsp;To pass the time, I opted to engage in nonsensical banter with the crew over the airwaves, hurling these er, childish insults at each other, exchanging life stories and all. It was all harmless fun. Nothing was supposed to happen. I looked to the diagnostics to reaffirm my thoughts... and it told me much of the same: Indeed, nothing was going to happen.

&emsp;...

&emsp;As we spoke the um, communications suddenly ceased, rather violently actually. We were speaking one moment, then the next, radio silence. I opened my mouth-

&emsp;"Hello?"

&emsp;Nothing. Yeah, no. Something happened.

&emsp;I- It didn't take me long for me to realize something went awry. I donned my helmet on, then ventured outside...

&emsp;The station was reduced to rubble floating about. The alarms in my suit had begun ringing. That loud, blaring sound only foreshadowed the tragedy that is to come. In this case, *has* come.

&emsp;...

&emsp;I froze, foot set in place.

&emsp;Over the radio, I instinctively spoke. I would've hoped that someone was around to reply. No one had responded. Well... I'd already come to grips with this grim reality I already exist in. Fuck it. I was going to return to the *Mini*, ascend, and spend the duration of the journey reflecting on days past...

&emsp;And that was what exactly what I had done. I was indifferent.

&emsp;That brings me to this moment in time. We've already informed Mission Control of everything that the unexpected explosion had taken from us, food, materials... chief among these, our comrades...

&emsp;After all that had happened, we needed to recount all the resources we were left with-

&emsp;Our current supply of crops was more or less cut down to just a third the amount we'd started out with. It was to going to be an seven-month ordeal with the cosmic elements and all, and with that, we had to plan our rations out for all of those months.

&emsp;Logs like this might now be few and far between. Say, a recording every single month, seeing that we're to spend most of our time performing maintenance on the ship, and looking after our unconscious mission commander, among other things.

&emsp;Even if I still do get the time to talk to this fucking machine, I might not be able to offer, er, insight of any sort, rather, I might just use it to log anything of note and the like.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Well anyway, it was time to set a course for Mars.

&emsp;I've grown a beard now.

&emsp;Our first week here, we were a bit too overzealous with our consumption of our food supply for some reason. We'd learned the hard way, like uh, a week after the fact. We looked down at our rations and found ourselves on track to fully consume our supply before we could get three-fourths of the way to Mars.

&emsp;We had to half our ration for this entire month in order to be able to meet our future selves' demand for sustenance. I have never felt weaker than I have now, it's... incomparable to anything I've ever felt before.

&emsp;...

&emsp;The commander was still breathing, thank God. We had been keeping him on a steady diet of blended potatoes and carrots, with the occasional dessert, of course. I mean, why not? It wasn't going to be of any consequence anyway.

&emsp;Save for some course corrections that had to be done, nothing had happened.

&emsp;Sometimes though, I wish that there would be this difficult problem that's very well suited to my skillset, where if we fail, the entire world will "die". I'm the only one who could solve this theoretical problem, so the world calls on me, and then by some freak, miraculous event, I succeed...

&emsp;Monuments will be made after me, my name will burnt into the annals of world history. My name will be celebrated across eons of human history, and I will be remembered.

&emsp;Instead, this mission will be remembered not because of the success of the crew leading it, but because of our colossal failure. The only thing I really fear is that our story will not be told. That, um, the children of our children will not hear of the tragedy of this very mision, and will be bound to repeat our mistakes.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Anyway, no use in wasting what little energy I have on contemplating over events that are completely out of my control. We needed to get to Mars in one piece.

&emsp;... I think that would be it for now. Peace.

&emsp;It's been two days since our last ration.

&emsp;First week of March, and we have completely burnt through our remaining supply of pre-packaged food. Our diet was all going to be made up of root crops from here on out, and it was something we didn't have a sizeable amount of.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Doing much of anything began to feel like a chore. Not that I was a lazy man, but doing any one thing was painful. I'd held off on making this recording for three days actually. I didn't really know if I wanted to talk about things and all.

&emsp;Our days on this ship were mundane, solitary.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Most of our time was spent micromanaging everything.

&emsp;Save for some course corrections that had to be done... nothing. *Mon Dieu*, it was uninteresting. I might consider bothering some of the folks down on Mission Control in search for any semblance of companionship, and anything of the sort.

&emsp;But for now, this is where we part.

&emsp;I searched for comfort, solace, in the messages that Mission Control and I had exchanged with each other, and solace, I have temporarily found. That fleeting feeling is no more, instead now I dread... Dread what? Nothing.

&emsp;Nothing? Exactly.

&emsp;I dread, nothing. The feeling of nothing, the existence of nothing. Emptiness. *Comprenez vous*?

&emsp;...

&emsp;Our current water supply has now reached the two-thirds mark. We were going to have to start rationing that too. The commander was still under, but fortunately still in a stable condition.

&emsp;My co-pilot had picked up journaling. With all the time that I'd spent getting to know him, I never really took him for a writer. I stand corrected. After all, we did need something to offset the boredom that the journey brought with it.

&emsp;I've nothing else to say.

&emsp;I-

&emsp;It has been four days since I last ate. Our supply of root crops will only last us another month. Even if we stretch out the days between meals, it will, at most, only lend us another month...

&emsp;It has been three days since I last ate and I already feel all sorts of ways.

&emsp;...

&emsp;Our current supply of water will see us through the remaining two months, and then some, so there's that.

&emsp;We had to um... what was it...

&emsp;We had to perform repairs on the panels when it had incurred some damage from a couple of fast-moving stray objects. There was no possible way to bring it back up to its full operational capability, considering that we lacked the tools to patch the holes that the damned things punched through the panels.

&emsp;The panels still do work, we just needed to be wary of our energy consumption from here on out. Certain parts of the craft had to be turned off, we couldn't risk the computer suddenly shutting off. Everything was dependent on the ship's mainframe-

&emsp;The regulation of the air that we breathe, the navigation systems, correspondences, et cetera.

&emsp;Ah, yes. Speaking of correspondences...

&emsp;The powers that be finally got around to speaking with the crew, or at least, whoever was left of it.

&emsp;An exchange of expletives later, we'd been informed of their intention to issue a press release to those, I quote, "journalist hacks". I'm sure these "journalist hacks" won't be too pleased when they catch wind of this.

&emsp;The higher-ups, for some reason, seemed to not care for the failure of the mission.

&emsp;According to them, apparently, our return was a victory in and of itself. We (I) had asked for a goliath challenge of our own, and a goliath challenge we have received.

&emsp;Staying alive, staying alive.

&emsp;*coughs*

&emsp;We're a month away from Mars now.

&emsp;...

&emsp;As I continue to slip into delirium, as the days become nothing but a passing moment, I feel as if death itself inhabits these very walls made to keep us out of the deep dark space. I feel as if... my very existence is now beginning to elude me.

&emsp;Anyway...

&emsp;We've set aside a quarter of whatever remaining potatoes we had for the commander. As for the other three-quarters? Careful rationing will allow us to stretch our supply out to over a month...

&emsp;...

&emsp;In the annals of history, there have been a notable few people who passed on food for astounding amounts of time.

&emsp;There exists one who had gone 382 days without food. The difference was that, the situation we find ourselves in was vastly different to his-

&emsp;He *willingly* went through all 382 days without food, and to add, he carried with him plenty of fat. He actually had the energy to expend for the challenge.

&emsp;As for us? We never had wanted to be in this situation to begin withB. Before leaving all of civilization for Ceres, as far as I'm concerned, we all were in peak physical condition, possessing an astoundingly low percentage of body fat at the time.

&emsp;...

&emsp;All of us were trained in various disciplines in preparation for the rigors of living in space and all. Energy conservation wasn't in the conversation, matter of fact, we were supposed to expend energy on exercise, and strength training.

&emsp;Low gravity affects muscles and bones in all sorts of ways, which is why exercise was imperative...

&emsp;Hell, I've never looked as slender as I do now...

&emsp;...

&emsp;My co-pilot has stayed confinded to his bed. His habit of journaling hasn't escaped him yet, he continues to will himself to sit upright, put pen on paper, and write away...

&emsp;At the end of the day, will is really the only thing that keeps us alive.

&emsp;...

&emsp;The individuals down at ESOC have never stopped sending us messages of motivation. I applaud them for this, but life as it is only continues to be more difficult as the days pass.

&emsp;Potatoes are no more...

&emsp;We were nearing Mars. Three more weeks.

&emsp;...

&emsp;We've gotten in touch with the Arcadia settlement...

&emsp;*coughs, then (apparently) spits*

&emsp;I'm- I'm terribly sorry. I just feel... cold. My co-pilot finds himself suffering from a fever. Staying alive in and of itself was now a task. One that we're struggling in carrying out. I don't think I'll be in any condition to do much of... *coughs*

&emsp;Anything, really.

&emsp;I promise that I'll stick around to tell the tale. I promise...

&emsp;If you are indeed hearing of this message, then that means I stuck around and did everything in my power to stay alive...

&emsp;For now, au revoir. Speaking puts quite the strain on my throat.

&emsp;...
